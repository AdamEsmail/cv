# Curriculum Vitae of Adam Esmail

## Summary

I have just completed my PhD in Experimental Physics at the Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge. My PhD was on the charge dynamics in superconducting nanodevices. This involved designing and manufacturing superconducting devices consisting of Josephson junctions, and performing electronic measurements at extremely low temperatures (below -273 C!)

### Skills 
#### Technical
- Clean-room fabrication, including
- Low temperature physics, including operation of a dilution refrigerator
- Building, running and troubleshooting experimental rigs
